    <h1>Psyduck</h1>
    <p>Psyduck is a yellow Pokémon resembling a duck or a bipedal platypus. On top of its head are three thick strands
        of black hair, and it has a wide, flat cream-colored beak. Psyduck's eyes seem vacant and have tiny pupils. Its
        legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands.

        Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile,
        trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form
        of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and
        the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be
        seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pokémon Snap.</p>

    <p>Psyduck seems to be just a standard Water-type on the surface, but below that lies an interesting difference.
        Psyduck is one of the few Pokemon with the Cloud Nine ability, allowing safe revenge killing of threats such as
        Drilbur. Psyduck is fast enough to use a Choice Scarf as it reaches 14 Speed unboosted, and it has a good
        movepool to hit opponents with. Sadly, it's not all good news for Psyduck. Its stats are a bit lacking, and most
        of what it can do would be horribly outclassed if not for its situational ability. Overall, Psyduck is an
        interesting option, if only for the fact that it is a safe choice to KO the important Drilbur.</p>
