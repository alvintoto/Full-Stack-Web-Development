    <h1>Froakie</h1>
    <p>Froakie is a quadrupedal, frog-like Pok√©mon. It has light-blue skin, white hands, and a dark blue stripe from the
        center of its oval head to its nose. It has three fingers and two toes on its hands and feet. Its eyes, which
        have yellow sclerae, black irises, and white pupils, protrude vertically from its head due to their size.
        Froakie produces a large mane of bubbles from its chest and back and has two small bubbles on its nose. The
        delicate yet flexible bubbles, called Frubbles, reduce the damage Froakie takes from attacks. Despite its
        carefree attitude, it is vigilant of its surroundings. Froakie is both light and
        strong, making it capable of jumping incredibly high.</p>

    <p>Froakie's niche lies in its ability, Protean, which changes Froakie's type to match that of the move it is using.
        While this in itself may not seem interesting, it also provides Froakie with a STAB boost on every single attack
        it uses. Coupled with a usable base 62 Special Attack stat and Life Orb, Froakie hits fairly hard. To take
        advantage of this, Froakie has a wide array of both physical and special attacks that let it hit most targets
        for fairly good damage. Froakie's good Speed stat lets it hit 17 Speed, allowing it to outspeed a good portion
        of the metagame. However, Froakie's poor defenses force it to rely on OHKOing foes before taking any damage,
        which makes it very susceptible to priority, namely Fletchling's Acrobatics. Furthermore, Froakie's Speed stat,
        while good, still leaves it outsped by common threats such as Diglett and Gastly.</p>
